<p>
    Kyiv is the capital and the largest city of <b>Ukraine</b>, located in the 
    north central part of the <b>country </b> on the Dnieper River. The name Kyiv is derived 
    from the name of Kiy, one of four legendary founders of the city. By the ancient legend 
    Kyiv was founded by three brothers <b>Kiy, Schek, Khoriv</b>  and their sister Lybid. They were surprised 
    by the beauty of Dnieper’s hills, stopped to settle here and called the town in honour of the eldest brother-Kyiv. 
    A monument to the founders was erected at the Dnieper embankment in our days. The town’s place was chosen succesfully, 
    the high Dnieper’s slopes were perfect protection against the raids of nomad tribes
